# Anti-sleep-alarm-for-drivers
Feeling sleepy while driving could cause hazardous traffic accident. However, when driving alone on highway or driving over a long period of time, drivers are inclined to feel bored and sleepy, or even fall asleep. Nowadays most of the products of driver anti-sleep detection sold in the market are simply earphone making intermittent noises, which is quite annoying and inefficient. As such, there is a high demand for cheap and efficient driver sleep detection. Therefore, we came up with an idea and successfully developed a sleepy detection and alarming system, which could effectively meet this demand.
